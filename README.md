# ML_Fire

This repo contains a machine learning exercise I conducted on a dataset of environmental variables on the West Coast 
and it's correlation to fire forest severity. It is a work in progress and the research paper was used for a final 
paper in a graduate level Machine Learning course (CPE695 @ Stevens).
